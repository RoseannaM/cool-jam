## Why use the JAMstack?

It's fast! Get that prototype out in no time.
Hosting a fully featured web page is also no trouble, forms, domains and authentication is handled for you.

No design experience? Well that's no problem because Stack Bit offers a whole host of templates and themes for you to use. 

No security experts to handle auth? Just deploy and rely on third party API's to manage user information and authentication.

Need to manage constantly updating content? It just got a lot easier. Changes and deployments with the click of a button. Leverage a CMS system to manage content with ease.
